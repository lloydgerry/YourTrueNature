    <h3>INDIVIDUAL THERAPY</h3>
    <p>
      Lana Marie is available to work one on one to help you with a variety of
      life’s challenges and possibilities. One of her clients once said
      “Everyone needs a Lana.” The world would be a much different place if we
      all did our personal inner work. There are times in our lives when all of
      us could use the assistance of a therapist to move through difficult times
      or simply to find ways to live more attuned to our deeper truths so we can
      live a more satisfying and joyful existence. Our lives are precious, and
      the world needs us to be more conscious and aware of our how we walk on
      the earth with ourselves and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lana Marie creates a safe and supportive space using her unique approach
      to therapy. Somatic methods based on neuropsychological research are
      combined with transpersonal methods of healing to explore the deeper
      patterns and issues to which you may not normally have access. Clients are
      often surprised at what unfolds during a session as there is a vast array
      of information that is held in our unconscious and which is accessible
      through present moment awareness in the presence of a compassionate
      observer. No two sessions are ever the same, and the process is customized
      to your particular needs in the moment.
    </p>
    Lana Marie does not diagnose or prescribe. Nothing is imposed during a
    session. The process is gentle, spacious and nonjudgemental. Rather than
    analyzing or pathologizing your behavior, she will help you mindfully study
    what is true for you, to discover old patterns and constructs that have
    previously been hidden, heal blocked emotional pain, and explore new
    possibilities of perceiving and responding to life, to yourself, and to
    others. She will help you discover Your True Nature!
    <p>
      Presenting issues may include:<br />
      Stress, depression, anxiety, phobias, relationship issues, shock and/or
      relational trauma, grief/loss, transistion, physical issues, unexplained
      pain, personal growth, general dissatisfaction Lana Marie will help you
      effectively deal with life’s challenges, face difficult decisions, and she
      is especially gifted at helping you to live with more love and awareness
      in all areas of your life.
    </p>
    <h3>COUPLES</h3>
    <p>
      Lana Marie has the expertise to assist in exploring relationship issues
      with you and your partner, friend, or family member. Both parties must be
      willing to look into the issues together. Lana Marie does not coach or
      tell you what to do. She will assist you to both become more mindful of
      yourselves and each other. She will teach you how to listen deeply to each
      other, and will work with individual issues as they arise with the other
      person present as witness. Most couples are delighted with the new
      possibilities that arise for how to live together in more harmony and
      fulfillment, however, Lana Marie has no attachment to the outcome of the
      therapy. What is most important is that you become empowered to know what
      is best and true for yourselves and each other. Sometimes seeing a
      therapist is the best way to actually end a relationship with compassion
      and awareness.
